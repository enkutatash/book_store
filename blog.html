                    <div class="blog-text"> Charlie Hall has never found a lock she couldn’t pick,
                        a book she couldn’t steal, or a bad decision she
                        wouldn’t make. She's spent half her life working for
                        gloamists, magicians who manipulate shadows to peer
                        into locked rooms, strangle people in their beds, or
                        worse. Gloamists guard their secrets greedily,
                        creating an underground economy of grimoires. And to
                        rob their fellow magicians, they need Charlie Hall.
                        Now, she’s trying to distance herself from past
                        mistakes, but getting out isn’t easy. Bartending at a
                        dive, she’s still entirely too close to the corrupt
                        underbelly of the Berkshires. Not to mention that her
                        sister Posey is desperate for magic, and that
                        Charlie's shadowless, and possibly soulless, boyfriend
                        has been hiding things from her. When a terrible
                        figure from her past returns, Charlie descends into a
                        maelstrom of murder and lies.</div>
